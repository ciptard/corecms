# core.cms

## Core is a flexible ajax driven CMS devolped by Simon Jakobsson and further developed by Andreas Klein. 
After one year stopped development i want expand this beautiful ajax and php driven Content-Management System. 
Currently i work on a new deployed version of core (1.31) with an revised installer, a new feature which allows 
the user to install/deinstall themes. In further steps i want to implement a extension handler. 

If you find issues or want to help me develop core, fork this project on git.
